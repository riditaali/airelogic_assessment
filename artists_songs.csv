Coldplay,Fix You,"When you try your best, but you don't succeed, When you get what you want but not what you need, When you feel so tired, but you can't sleep, Stuck in reverse, And the tears come streaming down your face, When you lose something, you can't replace, When you love someone, but it goes to waste, Could it be worse? Lights will guide you home, And ignite your bones, And I will try to fix you, And high up above or down below, When you're too in love to let it go, But if you never try, you'll never know, Just what you're worth, Lights will guide you home, And ignite your bones, And I will try to fix you, Tears stream down your face, When you lose something, you cannot replace, Tears stream down your face and I, Tears stream down your face, I promise you, I will learn from my mistakes, Tears stream down your face and I, Lights will guide you home, And ignite your bones, And I will try to fix you"
Coldplay,Viva La Vida,"Woah, oh, oh-oh, oh, Woah, oh, oh-oh, oh, Woah, oh, oh-oh, oh, Woah, oh, oh-oh, oh, I used to rule the world, Seas would rise when I gave the word, Now in the morning I sleep alone, Sweep the streets I used to own, I used to roll the dice, Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes, Listen as the crowd would sing, Now the old king is dead! Long live the king! One minute I held the key, Next the walls were closed on me, I discovered that my castles stand, Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand, I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing, Roman Calvary choirs are singing, Be my mirror, my sword and shield, Missionaries in a foreign field, For some reason I can't explain, Once you go there was never, Never an honest word, That was when I ruled the world, It was the wicked and wild wind, Blew down the doors to let me in, The shattered windows and the sound of drums, People couldn't believe what I'd become, Revolutionaries wait, For my head on a silver plate, I'm just a puppet on a lonely string, Oh who would ever want to be king? Now I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing, Roman Calvary choirs are singing, Be my mirror, my sword and shield, Missionaries in a foreign field, For some reason I can't explain, I know Saint Peter won't call my name, Never an honest word, That was when I ruled the world, Woah, oh, oh-oh, oh, Woah, oh, oh-oh, oh, Woah, oh, oh-oh, oh, Woah, oh, oh-oh, oh, Woah, oh, oh-oh, I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing, Roman Calvary choirs are singing, Be my mirror, my sword and shield, Missionaries in a foreign field, For some reason I can't explain, I know Saint Peter won't call my name, Never an honest word, That was when I ruled the world, Woah, oh, oh-oh, oh, Woah, oh, oh-oh, oh, Woah, oh, oh-oh, oh, Woah, oh, oh-oh, oh, Woah, oh, oh-oh, oh, Woah, oh, oh-oh, oh, Woah, oh, oh-oh, oh, Woah, oh, oh-oh, oh"
EdSheeran,Shape Of You,"The club isn't the best place to find a lover, So the bar is where I go, Me and my friends at the table doing shots, Drinking fast and then we talk slow, And you come over and start up a conversation with just me, And trust me I'll give it a chance now, Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox, And then we start to dance, and now I'm singing like, Girl, you know I want your love, Your love was handmade for somebody like me, Come on now, follow my lead, I may be crazy, don't mind me, Say, boy, let's not talk too much, Grab on my waist and put that body on me, Come on now, follow my lead, Come, come on now, follow my lead, I'm in love with the shape of you, We push and pull like a magnet do, Although my heart is falling too, I'm in love with your body, And last night you were in my room, And now my bedsheets smell like you, Every day discovering something brand new, I'm in love with your body, Oh-I-oh-I-oh-I-oh-I, I'm in love with your body, Oh-I-oh-I-oh-I-oh-I, I'm in love with your body, Oh-I-oh-I-oh-I-oh-I, I'm in love with your body, Every day discovering something brand new, I'm in love with the shape of you, One week in we let the story begin, We're going out on our first date, You and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat, Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate, We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour, And how your family is doing okay, Leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat, Tell the driver make the radio play, and I'm singing like, Girl, you know I want your love, Your love was handmade for somebody like me, Come on now, follow my lead, I may be crazy, don't mind me, Say, boy, let's not talk too much, Grab on my waist and put that body on me, Come on now, follow my lead, Come, come on now, follow my lead, I'm in love with the shape of you, We push and pull like a magnet do, Although my heart is falling too, I'm in love with your body, And last night you were in my room, And now my bedsheets smell like you, Every day discovering something brand new, I'm in love with your body, Oh-I-oh-I-oh-I-oh-I, I'm in love with your body, Oh-I-oh-I-oh-I-oh-I, I'm in love with your body, Oh-I-oh-I-oh-I-oh-I, I'm in love with your body, Every day discovering something brand new, I'm in love with the shape of you, Come on, be my baby, come on, Come on, be my baby, come on, Come on, be my baby, come on, Come on, be my baby, come on, Come on, be my baby, come on, Come on, be my baby, come on, Come on, be my baby, come on, Come on, be my baby, come on, I'm in love with the shape of you, We push and pull like a magnet do, Although my heart is falling too, I'm in love with your body, Last night you were in my room, And now my bedsheets smell like you, Every day discovering something brand new, I'm in love with your body, Come on, be my baby, come on, Come on, be my baby, come on, I'm in love with your body, Come on, be my baby, come on, Come on, be my baby, come on, I'm in love with your body, Come on, be my baby, come on, Come on, be my baby, come on, I'm in love with your body, Every day discovering something brand new, I'm in love with the shape of you"
PinkFloyd,Shine On You Crazy Diamond,"Remember when you were young, you shone like the sun, Shine on you crazy diamond, Now there's a look in your eyes, like black holes in the sky, Shine on you crazy diamond, You were caught on the crossfire of childhood and stardom, Blown on the steel breeze, Come on you target for faraway laughter, Come on you stranger, you legend, you martyr, and shine, You reached for the secret too soon, you cried for the moon, Shine on you crazy diamond, Threatened by shadows at night, and exposed in the light, Shine on you crazy diamond, Well you wore out your welcome with random precision, Rode on the steel breeze, Come on you raver, you seer of visions, Come on you painter, you piper, you prisoner, and shine"
PinkFloyd,The Great Gig in the Sky,"And I am not frightened of dying, Any time will do, I don't mind, Why should I be frightened of dying? There's no reason for it, you've gotta go sometime, If you can hear this whispering you are dying"
PinkFloyd,Have A Cigar,"Come in here, dear boy, have a cigar, You're gonna go far, you're gonna fly, You're never gonna die, You're gonna make it if you try, They're gonna love you, Well I've always had a deep respect, And I mean that most sincere, The band is just fantastic, That is really what I think, Oh by the way, which one's pink? And did we tell you the name of the game, boy, We call it 'riding the gravy train', We're just knocked out, We heard about the sell out, You gotta get an album out, You owe it to the people, We're so happy we can hardly count, Everybody else is just green, Have you seen the chart? It's a helluva start, It could be made into a monster, If we all pull together as a team, And did we tell you the name of the game, boy, We call it 'riding the gravy train'"
