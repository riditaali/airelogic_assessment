#The instructions for installing the required libraries are in a text file.
#The programs have been written in a Jupyter Notebook.
#A text file has been created to have the lyrics to be loaded before runing the initial program.
#A csv file has been created to contain the list of songs to be used for the program.
#There is a line within the program where the csv is converted to text file to do further analysis. This csv file is within the zip file. But if the user wants, it can be generated newly.
